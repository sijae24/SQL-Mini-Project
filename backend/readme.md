üìö Library Management System ‚Äì Backend

This is the backend for the Mini-Project. It uses **Flask** (Python) and **SQLite** as the database. The backend exposes a complete RESTful API that supports all required operations for the frontend React application.

As already noted in the Setup Instructions:


1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository & Navigate to Backend Folder

        cd backend

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment and Activate It

        Windows:
            python -m venv venv
            venv\Scripts\activate
            
        Mac/Linux:

            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

        pip install -r requirements.txt

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask Server

        python app.py

The backend should now be running at:

        http://127.0.0.1:5000/
